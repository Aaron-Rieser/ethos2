MVP___ 

CHECK PRD FIRST - IF NOT, RUNPLAN: 

Comments on map - pop down vs. Roll down. For this and all states. No trigger that you can comment 
- remove the 'scroll for' button instead add a 'click' for 
- popup on mobile needs to be no bigger then the screen area 
- need a differentiator between POPUP and placing LOCATION - this is missing 
On mobile, posts are staying up better but need to be more sticky (time limit?) for UI
Like UI - better
Adjust change distance from IN feed
New format, recommendations, questions (and posts? Gripes? History?)
- ensure likes work and they show on map
Search is broken 
- Fix Search UI
Delete post feature 
Homepage should be the map
- Nav to map present easier
Missing refresh token for login/logout. Persistent login issues, debug all login and create detection for a hard reset if needed
Persistent location issues on chrome/ etc. debug all location
Manual select location on map
- Treat page with NO location allowed? Default to manual
Feed on black, or incorporate more gumshoe text?
Route to real site 
Multiple comment design a bit smoother
- Comment ranking logic 
Add back action noises - like post message etc.
- downvote notification and algo consideration (but not displayed)
Email or text notifications 
FUN launch feature: Rando meet? Local biz offer? Parties? Points for best of the week?
- Challenge launch + broadcast message feed 
Message notification design 
Weather/traffic feeds bring back
Add profile picture quality 
Ensure consistent UX / Nav between all pages 
- Corporate logo
- Contact and help page 
Content moderation tools and notification - ban lists 
Widen posts for desktop, better look at them?
1 account = 1 like
Splash page intro, with note on Map usage
MEET Wilbur, J.Borg, D.McIntyre
Wipe all content 
GTM plan

----- ALL ELSE ------- 

CONSIDER Add city boundaries w/ geojson

ALT Parse float to server query for long/lat
ALT DM feature for Blinds with reveal button 
ALT change profile name feature 
ALT multi image posts

NOTES

Location issues: before a hard logon - account is identified but posts/deals = missing refresh token. Hard login works though (out and in) ALSO error loading posts. Same as a successful  "choose location" but flashes then shows deals.. connected?
- need a better default experience (Lindy way, point below?) 
- Reference Instacart location checking

First time viewing; Error loading messages. Please try again later. (Msg or posts) - but when we nav back after another page it works


FUTURE SCOPE 

Subscribe to areas 

Rules based communities (email - uni, work - self drawn boundaries, passcode) 
- Users set up and top displayed on HP wth ability to hide 

Rules based information exchange 
- like blind but other collection - email, address, form intake, for groups to collect and communicate easier w/ constituents  without intermediary services but only based on location

Card flip for posts or blinds, like reading newspaper?
