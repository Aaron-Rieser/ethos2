CHECK PRD 

Create new env: export all db schemes from either pg or vscode. Then build it in pg. then re-connect env
Map logic - work on dividing screen by pixels and showing most popular in each section
Likes don't show on Blinds 
Choose to have a post on map or not 
DM feature for Blinds with reveal button 
- Including separate table for those maybe 
The way posts show up on the map is not right / Humber example - spacing wrong, too likes focussed?
View post from the map
1 account = 1 like 
New nav 
Easier nav to the fun map at the start 
Text on map styling, Search on Map in bottom nav
Cluster on map too much 
Deals not showing up on map
Square on map for privacy 
Missing refresh token for posts without re-login (fix RE login )
Like, time and proximity based algorithm 
Location issues: before a hard logon - account is identified but posts/deals = missing refresh token. Hard login works though (out and in) ALSO error loading posts. Same as a successful  "choose location" but flashes then shows deals.. connected?
- need a better default experience (Lindy way, point below?) 
- Reference Instacart location checking
- Persistent refresh?
Profile picture and profile styling
- Change profile name feature
Rando' meet feature 
Events cluster, friend call out cluster.. now or in p1? Something to pay for..? (Stripe) p1 though
- Party is one thing we could use...
Search UI 
Search Design 
Add multiple photos to a post
Lindy way, choose on map as a fallback, add this. 
- How to treat feeds with no location even allowed 
First time viewing; Error loading messages. Please try again later. (Msg or posts) - but when we nav back after another page it works
Styling on create page 
Fix change distance so it can be adjusted right in feed 
UX design between all pages, check 
Splash page 
Parse float to server query for long/lat
Add some UI action noises back 
Points for posting a deal
CONSIDER Add city boundaries w/ geojson
Message notification design 
Like UI design when you complete the action 
Fix weather/traffic information - bring back in feed
.error-message duplicate in map.html
Better send msg design on home
Add other cities to the geojson
Chat + reply widget (it's resizing when you try and type) and overall function and design etc. 
Widen post column for desktop 
Design for multiple comments, 
Sort comments by a new ranking? Likes or chronological?
Logo 
Home / Corporate page 
Email notifications for user actions (maybe send grid free tier)
Downvote notification ... but not shown, incorporated to Algo though 
Page and comments and likes all jittering around 
Delay on new posts persistent? DO posts still go to the bottom? Double check
Content moderation tools 
Ban list 
Traffic tagging 
Route real URL
Pinned items based on popularity
Auth page design
Shared CSS file for all design items
All debugging, device, browser testing


FUTURE SCOPE 

Subscribe to areas 

Rules based communities (email - uni, work - self drawn boundaries, passcode) 
- Users set up and top displayed on HP wth ability to hide 

Rules based information exchange 
- like blind but other collection - email, address, form intake, for groups to collect and communicate easier w/ constituents  without intermediary services but only based on location

Card flip for posts or blinds, like reading newspaper?
