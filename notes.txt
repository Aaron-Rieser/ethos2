NOTES

Location issues: before a hard logon - account is identified but posts/deals = missing refresh token. Hard login works though (out and in) ALSO error loading posts. Same as a successful  "choose location" but flashes then shows deals.. connected?
- need a better default experience (Lindy way, point below?) 
- Reference Instacart location checking

First time viewing; Error loading messages. Please try again later. (Msg or posts) - but when we nav back after another page it works


FUTURE SCOPE 

Subscribe to areas 

Rules based communities (email - uni, work - self drawn boundaries, passcode) 
- Users set up and top displayed on HP wth ability to hide 

Rules based information exchange 
- like blind but other collection - email, address, form intake, for groups to collect and communicate easier w/ constituents  without intermediary services but only based on location

Card flip for posts or blinds, like reading newspaper?
