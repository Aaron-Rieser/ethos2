Constant refresh to see messages live 
Map to homepage

Still persisting - First time trying to post in a new session, error = Missing Refresh Token (audience: 'https://dev-g0wpwzacl04kb6eb.ca.auth0.com/api/v2/', scope: 'openid profile email offline_access')
Chat + reply widget (it's resizing when you try and type) and overall function and design etc. 
CSS consistent post size on desktop that's a bit wider
CSS comment slight indent with an arrow for the first one, spacing for when there's multiple  
CSS icons for all functions
Email notifications for user actions (maybe send grid free tier)
Downvote notification or design when done 
Page and comments and likes all jittering around 
New upvotes not on deals sending posts to the bottom.. a tied time thing. Algorithm needed.

Content moderation tools in server .. somewhere outside public 
Route real URL
Change username function to account page

Specific privacy class for usernames for blinds
- idea: card flip like original scavenge design - for blinds. Maybe something to apply to all post classes full screen mobile with detective dossier design

Privacy option for some communities
Pinned deal, party, blind, article and post 'of the day' based on algorithm
