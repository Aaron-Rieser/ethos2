MUST DO : 

Deals now showing ; but this update not pushed live 
Also, need to apply the deals db changes to the prod db's
Sorting works better. Wait to see on the main feed
Main feed load quicker, and re-login email.
Need to sort the feed better 
Need to learn to actually kill servers. Not working and is needed every time we add a new endpoint
Next - need to add deals, blind and events
And add all functions back in for them 
Create a new combined feed that takes the new tables into account 
- separate design
First time trying to post in a new session, error = Missing Refresh Token (audience: 'https://dev-g0wpwzacl04kb6eb.ca.auth0.com/api/v2/', scope: 'openid profile email offline_access')
Local env the feed pulls are in the wrong spot
Post classes:, party, article 
Likes and dislikes on posts 
Flow from map to post is not clear, can be more logical
Algorithm that serves these post classes based on likes, recency and proximity 
Specific points and clout class for deals that ties to account
Specific privacy class for usernames for blinds
- idea: card flip like original scavenge design - for blinds. Maybe something to apply to all post classes full screen mobile with detective dossier design
Specific privacy class for location for party
Privacy option for some communities
Pinned deal, party, blind, article and post 'of the day' based on algorithm 
Ability to change username
Account pages
Nav as clean as possible 
Better auth design and an auth page
Show location on default if possible, tried and failed before (Geolocation api implementation to reduce requests?)
Create real map of Toronto and Southern Ontario cities in launch with revised geojson file - ai help on drawing it
Clean up comment design
Clean up post design
Shared CSS file for all design items?
Condense and design the feed pull 
Ads integrated 
Payment feature added for corporate deals or other items.
Proper logo
Splash page intro
Gumshoe organization page link from header with a contact us?
Backend content moderation system 
Backend hidden stats page
All debugging, device, browser testing

Design sprint
