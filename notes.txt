Ethos2 with a map and choosing of neighbourhoods function is also live. DEC 2nd:

- BACKUP on dec 1 was just prior to implementing most of these
- NOW map is initialized and you can click to feed, with pages showing just those posts from correct neighbourhood
- these are pulled with a custom URL for the neighbourhood name
- "name" is the field from GEOJSON file not AREA_NAME
- Custom URL has lots of feed.html code running it as well as server.js code 
- Need to update the click function and look into location detection but PICKING your neighbourhood from a map is going well


OLD NOTES: NOV 30 and before

ethos2 is functional !! YAS !

database = postgresql://postgres:vKXvcmZdIzhIqGRxdOLWTvAXCeZyagJl@junction.proxy.rlwy.net:50368/railway
using DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL varialbe - 
- pull from postgres database
- then CALL it in the code tab
- and MAKE SURE the code itself actually uses it

Then using the db.js format and other js formats
Loading all the pacakge json's into the repo with the right repo creation

Look over all code, back it up, and look over all Ai assistants

This is the base to start off

NEXT: Create an OUTPUT PAGE
!!! 

THEN: ALl styling and launch

Note - handling SSL locally to database vs railway, modify db.js.. not now but in the future.
